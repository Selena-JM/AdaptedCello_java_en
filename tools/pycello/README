Install:

```
$ pip install --editable .
```


Test installation:

+ If successful, the installation creates a shell command called 'cello'.  

```
$ cello
```

This should show a list of available commands.

If the installation failed, try running the python script instead of using the shell command:

```
$ python cello_client.py
```


Test command:

The 'cello' shell command can be followed by any sub-command in the main menu, such as 'submit'.  Any sub-command can be followed by --help to show a help menu.

```
$ cello submit --help
```
or
```
$ python cello_client.py submit --help
```
